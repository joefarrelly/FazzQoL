## Overview

FazzTools is a collection of a few quality of life changes that I wanted for my own use 
in WoW without needing to download multiple addons. Written entirely in LUA.

## Features

All features listed below are able to be switched on/off in-game:
* Hide the default player frame.
* Automatically insert your mythic keystone from your bags when interacting with the mythic font.
* Hide the talking head frame.
* Announce your keystone in chat when someone types in the command '!keys'. Separate options for Guild, Raid and Party chat.
* Message on login that tells you how many times the addon has seen the character you log in as.
* Message when you change zone that tells you the name of the zone you have just entered.
